{ts}Please configure the number of retry attempts that CiviCRM will make before marking the recurring contribution as failed.{/ts}
{ts}Note however that your payment processor, for example GoCardless, may already attempt to retry your payment before CiviCRM attempts to retry.{/ts}
{ts}In those situations you may wish to set this to 0 as GoCardless will already have retried the payment on your behalf.{/ts}
